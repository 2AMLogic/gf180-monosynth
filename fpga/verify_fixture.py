"""fpga/verify_fixture.py -- A MUSICAL FIXTURE THROUGH THE PRODUCTION CONTROL
PATH, BIT-COMPARED AGAINST model/synth_top_model.py.

    .venv/bin/python fpga/verify_fixture.py
    .venv/bin/python fpga/verify_fixture.py --wrong no-coef-seq --expect-fail

This is issue #81's acceptance test. Everything the instrument has demonstrated
so far was made by poking internal model state, or by `verify_synth_top.py`'s
coverage script, which bursts writes at the pins and then asks the model where
they happened to land. Neither is a musician.

WHAT RUNS HERE:

  fpga/fixtures.py  a bass line and a drum part -- key events, hits with
                    accents, three knobs
        |
  fpga/spi_host.py  the host: the register map, the reference conversions, the
                    TIMED COEFFICIENT SEQUENCES of contract 15.7.1, and a
                    schedule that says which frame each transaction lands in
        |
  48-bit frames     {F, 6'b0, SEC, A[7:0], D[31:0]}, one per write, over CS_N,
                    SCK and MOSI -- rtl-sketch/tb_top_bx.v's master
        |
  synth_top.v       the chip, unmodified
        |
  I2S wire          decoded from BCLK, LRCLK and SDATA the way a DAC does
        |
  == compared, with no tolerance, against ==
  model/synth_top_model.py driven by the HOST'S OWN PREDICTED FRAMES

THE ANTI-CIRCULARITY, which is the whole design. The model is driven by frames
the host computed BEFORE the simulation ran, from `spi_host.LinkTiming`. The
chip is separately required to agree: for every write, the host's prediction,
the frame the CS_N PIN predicts, and the frame the write actually drained in
must all be the same number. So a scheduler that is wrong about the link fails
here even when the audio would have matched, and a link that delays a write
cannot drag the model along with it.

  --wrong NAME   send a DELIBERATELY WRONG transaction stream while the model
                 keeps the correct schedule. This is docs/verification-rules.md
                 rule 1 for a host rather than for RTL: a bench that has never
                 been watched fail is not a bench.

                 no-coef-seq    the host loads the kit and forwards triggers
                                and does NOTHING ELSE -- the bridge #81 warns
                                about. Both sequences of 15.7.1 vanish.
                 drop-restore   the BD attack window opens and never closes
                 late-window    the window closes at 16 ms instead of 4 ms
                 no-tom-bend    the toms lose their diode pitch drop
                 drop-tom-step  one step of one bend goes missing
                 burst          the host sends every transaction back to back
                                with no schedule at all -- the naive bridge

  --fixture N    bar808 (default), bar808-full, demo
  --link NAME    bench (default, what tb_top_bx's master actually does) or max
  --expect-fail  exit 0 only if the comparison gave 1
  --frames N     override the run length

Exit status, as verify_ladder.py: 0 identical, 1 differed, 2 did not run --
which includes REFUSED.

ONE KNOWN-WRONG VALUE IS SENT ON PURPOSE. The toms' pitch drop ships at x1.7
(`drums_fx.TOM_DROP_RATIO`); measurement against 99 hardware files puts it at
x1.06 / x1.14 / x1.24 by accent (#110, merged), and #99 blocks the correction.
The host sends whatever the current model specifies. What is verified here is
the PATH, not the value, and a host that "fixed" it would verify neither.
