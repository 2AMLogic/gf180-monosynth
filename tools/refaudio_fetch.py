"""Fetch reference recordings named in refaudio/ into refaudio/cache/ (gitignored).

    python tools/refaudio_fetch.py <archive.zip> '<member path>' ['<member path>' ...]

The recordings live on operator-side storage, not in this repository; see
refaudio/README.md. This tool reaches them over ssh, and needs two things in
the environment that are deliberately not committed:

    REFAUDIO_SSH    user@host of the storage
    REFAUDIO_ROOT   the library directory on that host

THREE OUTCOMES, and they are kept apart on purpose:

    exit 0  FETCHED  every requested member is on disk, non-empty, and -- where
                     refaudio/index/ lists it -- exactly the size the index says
    exit 1  FAIL     the storage was reachable and the fetch went wrong
    exit 2  REFUSED  a precondition is not met, so nothing was attempted

REFUSED is not a failure of the recording and must never be read as one. A host
with no route to the storage is the normal case for most of the fleet: open a
`reference-audio` issue instead.

The defect this is built to not have: `unzip -p` on a member that does not
exist prints nothing, and a shell redirect of nothing is a zero-byte .wav that
every downstream tool will open. So status comes from the process, an empty
result is a FAIL, a partial file never survives, and a size that disagrees with
the index is a FAIL -- the file on disk must be the file the index describes.
