"""F1A / F1B / F1C re-expressed on the calibrated corner estimator (#150),
and the part of that re-expression this host CANNOT do, said out loud.

    .venv/bin/python tools/probes/filter_corner_recalibration.py

#146 concluded that our filter's two Filters failures are "one trend... the
discrepancy is in the cutoff mapping, not the passband". #150 showed the
instrument contributes part of that trend. This re-reads everything that can
be re-read with the repaired estimator and reports the delta.

THE ANSWER, SO IT IS NOT BURIED. Our own side of F1A/F1B/F1C moves by
-17.0 / -3.9 / -1.1 % at 250 / 1000 / 4000 Hz once the instrument is
corrected -- a 15.9-point trend on ONE SIDE of a comparison whose reported
trend is 8.2 points. #146's attribution cannot stand on that, and it cannot be
settled here either, because the reference side needs audio this host does not
have. Over 400 Hz-6.4 kHz, where five real devices CAN be re-read, the
instrument contributes at most 1.9 points in either direction and four of
eight devices get WORSE -- so the droop those devices show up there is theirs.
The instrument's contribution is a low-cutoff effect, and F1A is the low
cutoff.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT ANSWER, BEFORE ANY NUMBER
--------------------------------------------------
F1A/F1B/F1C compare OUR ladder against a FROZEN Surge Type 2 clip. Our side is
rendered here from the integer model and is exact. **The reference side is
audio that is not in this repository** -- `refprofile/cache/` is gitignored and
is re-rendered only on a host with the plugin -- so on a host without it the
reference corner cannot be re-measured and the F1 errors cannot be restated.
`run_case.py` says so itself, as a no-verdict with that reason, which is the
correct outcome and not a gap this probe should paper over.

What IS in the repository is `docs/reference-compare-results.json`: 56 real
measured response curves, five devices including Surge Type 2's own
Huovilainen mode, seven commanded cutoffs each, with their raw `freqs` and
`gain_db` arrays. Those can be re-read, and they answer the attribution
question #146 got wrong -- how much of an apparent trend across cutoffs is the
instrument -- on real plugin audio rather than on closed forms.

It exits non-zero if a stated invariant fails.
