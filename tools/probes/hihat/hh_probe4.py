"""Part 4: the correction.

Part 2's "cost 7.2, every band green" used the offline emulator for a knob the
emulator was never validated for -- the LOW band's envelope peak. Scaling a
captured signal by 2 is not what doubling E_CYL's peak does to the block: the
envelope's one-LSB floor lengthens the tail, so the low band gains MORE than
2x of energy over a 2 s window (T20 899 -> 1031 ms). Part 3 caught it.

So: the post-filter knob, which IS inside the emulator's validated scope, is
re-confirmed on the block; the envelope knob is swept on the block only.
