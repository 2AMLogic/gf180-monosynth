"""Would merging this branch actually LOSE a file? Answer by merging it.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY THE FIRST VERSION WAS WRONG. I raised the alarm three
times that a pull request "would delete" work it had nothing to do with -- and
twice I was wrong, because I compared the wrong two things:

    git diff main branch      (two-dot)  -> 29 "deletions"
    git diff main...branch    (three-dot) ->  0 deletions
    the actual merge                      ->  nothing lost

Two-dot asks "how do these two trees differ", so everything `main` gained since
the branch point shows up as a deletion *from the branch's perspective*. That is
an artefact of the comparison, not a property of the branch. GitHub shows
three-dot, and a merge uses the merge base correctly -- including a SQUASH
merge, which merges first and squashes the result.

So squash merging was never the problem. My comparison was.

THE CHECK. Do not reason about diffs at all: perform the merge with
`git merge-tree` and ask whether any path present in the base is absent from
the result and not deleted on purpose by this branch. That answers the question
being asked, rather than a related one that happens to be easy to compute.

Exit 0 clean, 1 if the merge would lose something, 2 if it could not run --
this repository's convention, where 2 means no evidence rather than no problem.
