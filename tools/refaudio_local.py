"""Extract reference recordings from a LOCAL copy of a refaudio archive.

    python tools/refaudio_local.py <archive.zip> '<member path>' ['<member>' ...]
    python tools/refaudio_local.py --prefix <archive.zip> '<folder prefix>'

`tools/refaudio_fetch.py` reaches operator-side storage over ssh. On a host
where the archive is already mounted locally (REFAUDIO_LOCAL points at the
directory holding the pack zips) that route REFUSES for the wrong reason: the
bytes are here, there is simply no ssh to them. This tool is the local twin and
keeps the SAME three outcomes and the SAME refusal to hand back a file it
cannot vouch for:

    exit 0  FETCHED  every member is on disk, non-empty, and -- where
                     refaudio/index/ lists it -- exactly the size the index says
    exit 1  FAIL     the archive was readable and the extraction went wrong
    exit 2  REFUSED  a precondition is not met, so nothing was attempted

It checks one thing `refaudio_fetch.py` cannot: the archive's **SHA-256 against
catalog.json**. Over ssh the remote pack is assumed to be the indexed one; a
local file could be any zip with the right name, so it is hashed once per run
and a mismatch is a REFUSAL, not a warning. Combined with the per-member size
check that is end-to-end provenance: these bytes are the bytes the committed
index describes.

Audio lands in refaudio/cache/ (gitignored), same as the ssh tool.
