"""The separator has to be right before anything measured with it is.

`model/drum_fit.py` decides how much of a struck hit is noise. Every number in
docs/drum-verification.md section 8 rests on it, including the one that
overturned "our snare's noise is 16 dB too quiet", so it is validated here two
ways and the method it replaced is kept as a control that must FAIL:

  1. against synthetic mixtures whose noise share is exact by construction;
  2. against our own renders, where the tonal path and the noise path can be
     rendered separately and the true share is exact arithmetic.

A control that cannot be shown wrong proves nothing, so
`test_the_whole_span_hann_split_is_the_artefact_it_is_recorded_as` asserts the
withdrawn method's error, not just the new method's accuracy.
