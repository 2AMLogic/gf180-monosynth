"""Can our digital 808 be told apart from a real one?

This module is the machinery; `model/discrimination_run.py` is the script that
drives it end to end and `docs/discrimination.md` is the written result. The
pytest functions at the bottom check the machinery itself, not the synth.

A discrimination test is easy to run in a way that proves nothing. Almost all
of the code here is about not doing that. The five things it is guarding
against, in the order they would have bitten us:

1. LEAKING THE KNOB SETTING. Fischer trimmed every file to its own decay, so
   `bd8/` runs from 0.25 s at DECAY 0.0 to 3.00 s at DECAY 10.0. File length
   alone identifies both the knob and the provenance. Every clip on both sides
   is therefore onset-aligned and cut to exactly WINDOW_S; nothing longer is
   ever looked at, and nothing shorter exists.

2. LEAKING THE RECORDING CHAIN. The real files carry a 1994 Macintosh
   Quadra 660AV's converter: about 1 LSB of DC and a floor near -76 dBFS.
   Our renders are digitally silent between hits. A classifier will happily
   score 100 % on that and learn nothing about synthesis. Both sides get a
   20 Hz high-pass and a floor clamp FLOOR_DB below the clip's own peak.
   `--no-floor-clamp` runs the ablation, and it is reported.

3. TWO REPRESENTATIONS, NOT ONE. The drum model was fitted against centroid
   and decay (docs/drum-verification.md). Measuring those on the settings the
   fit never saw is a legitimate generalisation test, and they are the
   quantities a circuit designer can act on, so they are kept:
   `interpretable_features()` reports f0, tau, band shares and centroid at the
   held-out settings. But they can only find what they measure, so the
   classifier runs on a general representation as well -- log-mel band
   energies and MFCCs over four time segments -- and the report says which
   groups carry the discrimination, per voice. Both, not one instead of the
   other.

4. FITTING AND TESTING ON THE SAME KNOB POSITIONS. The control law that turns
   a knob position into register values is fitted on FIT_KNOBS = {0.0, 5.0,
   10.0} and then frozen. Everything reported as a result is measured at
   TEST_KNOBS = {2.5, 7.5}, which the law has never seen. A setting with two
   knobs is a test setting if EITHER knob is held out, so the 16 held-out
   bass-drum settings also test the law's separability assumption.

5. CLAIMING MORE THAN THE POWER SUPPORTS. Every accuracy is reported with a
   Clopper-Pearson interval and with the one-sided upper bound that actually
   decides an equivalence claim. 10 of 20 correct is not "indistinguishable":
   its one-sided 95 % upper bound is 0.68.

TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS, WHICH MUST NOT BE CONFLATED (see EXP_* below):

    EXP_EMULATION      the model is given knob positions and note events only,
                       renders blind, and is compared. A pass here is evidence
                       about instrument emulation.
    EXP_SOUND_MATCHING the model was fitted to reproduce these very
                       recordings. A pass here is evidence about sound
                       matching and nothing more.

The knob law is fitted at FIT_KNOBS, so results at FIT_KNOBS are
EXP_SOUND_MATCHING and results at TEST_KNOBS are EXP_EMULATION. Every table
in the report is tagged. A sound-matching number is never presented as an
emulation number.

THE FLOOR, AND WHY THIS CORPUS CANNOT GIVE IT

The number that makes an "ours vs real" accuracy interpretable is the
"real vs real" accuracy: two genuine takes of the same voice at the same
knobs are not identical, because the 808's six hat oscillators free-run, its
noise generator is an avalanche diode and its components drift. If a
discriminator separates real from real at 80 %, then separating ours from
real at 85 % means very little.

That number cannot be computed from any freely licensed 808 material we could
obtain. Fischer states he recorded many hits of each sound and kept the one
he judged most representative, so the set has exactly ONE take per knob
setting; the 808 directories redistributed in tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples are
the same files. What this module computes instead is `separation_curve()`:
the discriminator's accuracy on real-versus-real pairs whose knob differs by
Δ = 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 of 10. That curve is an UPPER bound on the floor
(Δ = 0 is off its left edge, and every pair on it differs by a real knob
move), and it converts each voice's raw accuracy into the statistic that is
actually interpretable: the KNOB-EQUIVALENT SEPARATION -- how far apart the
real machine's own knob would have to be to look as different from itself as
our render looks from it. That is the finding. The raw accuracy is not.

SPLITTING IS BY RECORDING. The group key is the source recording, so a clip
and every processed version of it stay on the same side of every split.
`assert_split_disjoint()` enforces it rather than trusting it.
